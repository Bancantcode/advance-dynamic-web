        <p class="mb-4 text-md">Carpentry is not just a trade, but a deeply rooted craft that blends tradition with innovation. For centuries, carpenters have been the skilled artisans behind the creation of everything from humble wooden tools to grand architectural masterpieces. This timeless craft is built on a foundation of precision, creativity, and an intimate understanding of wood — a material that is as versatile as it is beautiful.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-md text-gray-600">At the heart of carpentry lies the skillful transformation of raw timber into something functional and artistic. From the construction of homes and furniture to the fine details of molding and cabinetry, carpenters use their hands, eyes, and tools to bring wood to life. Their work is a reflection of craftsmanship passed down through generations, yet it continues to evolve as new techniques and technologies are introduced. Whether it's an intricately carved staircase, a custom-built dining table, or the framing of a home, each project showcases the ability to turn a simple piece of wood into something extraordinary.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-md text-gray-600">Carpentry is also about problem-solving and adaptability. Every project presents unique challenges — whether it’s working with irregular materials, fitting custom pieces into specific spaces, or designing complex joinery. The ability to think creatively and work with precision allows carpenters to tackle these challenges and deliver results that are not only functional but visually stunning.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-md text-gray-600">In our gallery, you’ll find a collection of work that celebrates the versatility of carpentry. From large-scale architectural designs to small-scale custom pieces, each photograph tells a story of craftsmanship, innovation, and a dedication to quality. These images capture the incredible range of skills that carpenters bring to life — from the raw beauty of unfinished wood to the meticulous final details that elevate a project from ordinary to exceptional.</p>
